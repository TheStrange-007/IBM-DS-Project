## 🚀 Predicting Falcon 9 First Stage Landing 🛰️

Welcome to my exciting IBM Data Science Capstone Project! 🎉 As part of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate, I took on the role of a Data Scientist working for a startup looking to challenge SpaceX. 🌌

My task was to predict whether the first stage of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket would land successfully, using the Data Science methodology involving data collection, data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, data visualization, model development, model evaluation, and reporting. 📊🔍🧪

### Course Overview 📚

The course was split into several engaging modules:

##### Introduction 🚪
In this module, I was provided with an overview of the problem and the necessary tools to complete the project.

##### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 🔎
In this module, I collected data on the Falcon 9 first-stage landings using a RESTful API and web scraping. I also converted the data into a dataframe and performed data wrangling.

##### Interactive Visual Analytics and Dashboard 📊
In this module, I built an interactive dashboard to analyze launch records using Plotly Dash. Additionally, I created an interactive map to analyze the launch site proximity with Folium.

##### Predictive Analysis (Classification) 📈
In this module, I used machine learning algorithms to determine if the first stage of Falcon 9 would land successfully. I split the data into training and test sets and found the best Hyperparameters for SVM, Classification Trees, and Logistic Regression. Finally, I found the method that performed best using test data.

##### Present Your Data-Driven Insights 🎤
In this module, I compiled all my activities into one place and delivered my data-driven insights to determine if the first stage of Falcon 9 would land successfully.

### Project Description 📝

My task was to predict whether the first stage of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket would land successfully. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, costing 62 million dollars, while other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each. SpaceX can reuse the first stage, leading to significant cost savings. Therefore, if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch. 💰💸

### Technologies Used 💻

To complete this project, I utilized a range of cutting-edge technologies:

- Python 🐍
- Jupyter Notebook 📓
- Pandas 🐼
- NumPy 🔢
- Scikit-learn 🤖
- Matplotlib 📊
- Plotly Dash 📈
- Folium 🗺️
- RESTful API 🌐

### Conclusion 🎉

**This project was an exceptional opportunity to apply the Data Science methodology to a real-world problem. I gained experience in collecting, cleaning, and analyzing data, building models, and communicating findings. It was an enriching experience.**
